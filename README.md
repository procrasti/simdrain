# simdrain [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/procrasti/simdrain.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/procrasti/simdrain)

Simulates a bucket draining into another bucket with a leak in it... and try to calculate the volume in each bucket.

It compares the results of a discrete finite analysis versus an analytic solution to prove that it is correct.

Below is a graph made from the output of simdrain.py to show the expected volumes in both the buckets and their sum:
